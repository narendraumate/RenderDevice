# RenderDevice

A demonstration of a graphics library abstraction layer that you might see in a typical rendering engine for games and simulations.

## Dependencies

* C++11 Compiler
* CMake 3.2 or greater
* Linux
    * apt install cmake libgl-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev

## Features

* OpenGL 4.1 RenderDevice
    * Vertex Buffers
    * Index Buffers
    * Vertex Shaders
    * Fragment Shaders
    * 2D RGB Textures
    * Shader Uniform Variables
    * Raster States
    * Depth/Stencil States

* Platform Abstraction
    * Single window for the render viewport
    * Trackball interface for inspecting an object of interest

* Samples
    * Triangle: renders a static, solid-colored triangle in normalized device coordinates
    * Cube: renders a textured cube and supports the ability to rotate the cube with the left mouse button and zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel
